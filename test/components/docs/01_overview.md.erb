title: Lookbook Demo
---

**This is a demo of Lookbook, a _ready-to-go_ component development UI for [ViewComponent](http://viewcomponent.org/)-based projects.**

It uses (and extends) the native [ViewComponent preview functionality](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/previews.html), so you don't need to learn a new DSL or create any extra files to get up and running.

Lookbook uses [RDoc/Yard-style comment tags](<%= page_path :annotations %>) to extend the capabilities of ViewComponent's previews whilst maintaining compatability with the standard preview class format, so you can add or remove Lookbook at any time without having to rework your code.
