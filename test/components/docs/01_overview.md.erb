title: Lookbook v1.0 Demo
---

Lookbook is a tool to help develop, test and document [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org).

It provides a UI to let you browse your component library and develop, test and document each of your components in isolation.

It uses [RDoc/Yard-style comment tags](<%= page_path :annotations %>) to extend the capabilities of [ViewComponent's native previews](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/previews.html) whilst maintaining compatability with the standard preview class format, so you can add or remove Lookbook at any time without having to rework your code.
