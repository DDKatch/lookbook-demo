title: Lookbook Demo
---

Lookbook is a tool to help develop, test and document [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org) in Rails applications.

It provides a UI for browsing your component library, developing components in isolation and to help share component documentation with your wider team.

Lookbook uses [RDoc/Yard-style comment tags](<%= page_path :annotations %>) to extend the capabilities of ViewComponent's native previews whilst maintaining compatability with the standard preview class format, so you can add or remove Lookbook at any time without having to rework your code.
