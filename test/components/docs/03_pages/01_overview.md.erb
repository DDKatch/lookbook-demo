title: Pages Overview
---

If you need to add more long-form documentation to live alongside your component previews you can do so using Lookbook's markdown-powered `pages` system.

**The documentation you are reading right now** is an example what pages look like when they are rendered.

## Adding pages

Pages should be placed in the `test/components/docs` directory (although this [can be customised](/api/config#pages)) and can be nested in directories as deeply as required.

```
test/components/docs/
  ├── overview.md.erb
  ├── best_practices.md.erb
  └── branding/
      ├── logos.md.erb
      └── themes.md.erb
```


Pages must have either a `.html.erb` or a `.md.erb` file extension. All pages are rendered as ERB templates but `.md.erb` files will also additionally be run through a markdown parser.

Pages can optionally make use of a [YAML frontmatter block](/guide/pages/frontmatter/) to customise the behaviour and content of the page itself.

## Example page file

```markdown
---
title: An example page
label: Nice example
---

This is an example page. If it has a `.md.erb` file extension its
contents will be run through a Markdown parser/renderer before display.

Fenced code blocks are fully supported and will be highlighted appropriately.

ERB can be used in here.
The template will be rendered **before** being parsed as Markdown.

You can can access data about the page using the `@page` variable.
The title of this page is "<%= @page.title %>".
```
