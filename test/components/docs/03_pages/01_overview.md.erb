title: Pages Overview
---

If you need to add more long-form documentation to live alongside your component previews you can do so using Lookbook's markdown-powered `pages` system.

**The documentation you are reading right now** is an example what pages look like when they are rendered.

## Usage

By default, pages should be placed in the `test/components/docs` directory (although this can be customised) and can be nested in directories as deeply as required.

Pages must have  either a `.html.erb` or a `.md.erb` file extension. All pages are rendered as ERB templates but `.md.erb` files will also additionally be run through a markdown parser.

Pages can optionally make use of a **YAML frontmatter block** to customise the behaviour and content of the page itself.

An example page might look like this: 

```markdown
---
title: An example page
label: Nice example
---

This is an example page. If it has a `.md.erb` file extension its
contents will be run through a Markdown parser/renderer before display.

Fenced code blocks are fully supported and will be highlighted appropriately.

ERB can be used in here.
The template will be rendered **before** being parsed as Markdown. 

You can can access data about the page using the `@page` variable.
The title of this page is "&gt;%= @page.title %&lt;".
```
