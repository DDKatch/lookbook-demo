Add Lookbook to your `Gemfile` somewhere *after* the ViewComponent gem:

```ruby
gem "view_component"
gem "lookbook", ">= {{ lookbook_version }}" # latest v1.0 beta release
```

and then `bundle install` to install Lookbook.

Next mount the Lookbook engine (at a path of your choosing) in your routes file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  if Rails.env.development?
    mount Lookbook::Engine, at: "/lookbook"
  end
end
```

Then you can start your app as normal and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/lookbook` (or whatever mount path you specified) to view your component previews in the Lookbook UI.
