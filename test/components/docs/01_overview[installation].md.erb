Add Lookbook to your `Gemfile` somewhere **after** the ViewComponent gem. For example:

```ruby
gem "view_component", require: "view_component/engine"
gem "lookbook"
```

### 2. Mount the Lookbook engine

You then need to mount the Lookbook engine (at a path of your choosing) in your `routes.rb` file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  if Rails.env.development?
    mount Lookbook::Engine, at: "/lookbook"
  end
end
```

The `at` property determines the root URL that the Lookbook UI will be served at.

Then you can start your app as normal and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/lookbook` (or whatever mount path you specified) to view your component previews in the Lookbook UI.
